# Counter Application - Flet

This GitHub repository contains a simple counter application built using the [Flet](https://flet.dev/) library, a Python library for building interactive web, desktop, and mobile apps. The application allows users to increment and decrement a counter, with an interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Increment Counter:** Increases the counter by 1 when clicking the "+" button.
- **Decrement Counter:** Decreases the counter by 1 when clicking the "-" button (cannot go below zero).
- **Responsive UI:** The application adjusts the counter value on the fly and displays it in the center of the page.
- **Dark Theme:** The app comes with a pre-configured dark mode, but you can easily change it to light mode if preferred.
